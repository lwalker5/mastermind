//Lindsay Walker - Mastermind Game - HTML/CSS/Javascript

This is my take on the code breaking game, Mastermind. I've always had fun playing this game so I wanted to make an online version. 

Upon starting, a random sequence of colors is generated of either 4, 5, or 6 pegs depending on the difficulty chosen. For each row the player selects a combination of colors in hopes of matching it with the sequence generated. The program responds with some clues in the form of white and black pegs in no particular order. White indicates a correct color and black indicates a correct color and spot. Using the information the goal is to break the code in as few rows as possible. Additionally, the user has the ability to adjust colors within a row before commiting each guess. The user selections are stored in html data attributes which are used to update the images.
